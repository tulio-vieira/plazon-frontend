For example, there is nothing in the constitution that says districts need to be apportioned equally, so prior to Reynolds v. Sims states could (and did) have one district with 600 people and another with 100,000. The Warren court overturned this and many other laws (e.g. brown v board of education) by stretching the way precedent was interpreted. While the dissenting justices almost always agreed that the US would be a better place with the results we got through Brown and Reynolds, they dissented because they felt it was not the court's place to make up laws, and the correct vehicle for doing so was a constitutional amendment. So now you have supreme court nomination battles that really shouldn't be controversial at all, because it's power SCOTUS never should have had in the first place.",
